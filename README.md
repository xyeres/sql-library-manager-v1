# sql-library-manager-v1 (Techdegree Proj. #8)

This sample test project implements a basic CRUD application for a library cataloge. 

Using Node.js, the app was built with the Express JS framework and the Sequelize ORM (using SQLite3)

## To get running:
- Download the source code
- CD into root directory 
- In your terminal type `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm start` to boot server at localhost:3001 by default

## Exceeds Expectations
I have implemented the project specs for an "exceeds expectations" grading. Including the following:
### Search
Include a search field for the books listing page. Search should work for all of the following fields:
- Title
- Author
- Genre
- Year

Note: Searching should be case insensitive and be good for partial matches for strings.

### Pagination
- Include pagination for the books listing page.

glhf!
